SYNOPSIS
      use String::Perl::Warnings qw(is_warning);

      while( <> ) {
        chomp;
        next unless is_warning($_);
        # Looks like a warning
      }

DESCRIPTION
    String::Perl::Warnings can be used to determine if a string of arbitary
    text appears to look like a warning generated by perl.

    It includes all warnings for every stable perl release from 5.6.0 to
    5.12.0.

FUNCTIONS
    "is_warning"
        Takes an arbitary string of text and returns a true value if the
        string looks like a perl warning, a false value otherwise.

    "not_warning"
        Takes an arbitary string of text and returns a true value if the
        string does not look like a perl warning and a false value
        otherwise.
